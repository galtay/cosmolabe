Eisenstein and Hu 1998 Transfer Function
========================================

This transfer function fit is described in the article "Baryonic Features in 
the Matter Transfer Function" by Eisenstein and Hu (EH98_).  It 
describes three transfer function fits,

The "zero baryon" fit, :math:`T_{zb}(k)`
  In this fit, all baryons are treated as cold dark matter.  There is no 
  supression at high wave numbers and no oscillations. 

The "no wiggles" fit, :math:`T_{nw}(k)`
  In this fit, the supression due to baryons is included but only the 
  shape, not the oscillations. 

The full transfer function fit, :math:`T(k)`
  In the full transfer function fit, both the supression and the oscillations
  due to baryons are included.  

The last fit is the most accurate when compared to the numerical results 
of the code CMBfast, but the other two provide useful comparisons and have
simpler forms.  


The Full Transfer Function Fit
==============================

   `"We write the transfer function as the sum of two pieces,`

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
     T(k) &= \frac{\Omega_{\rm b}}{\Omega_{\rm m}} T_b(k) +
     \frac{\Omega_{\rm c}}{\Omega_{\rm m}} T_c(k)
   \end{aligned}

   `whose origins lie in the evolution before the drag epoch of the
   baryons and cold dark matter, respectively.  This separation is
   physically reasonable, as before the drag epoch the two species
   were dynamically independent and after the drag epoch their
   fluctuations are weighted by the fractional density they
   contribute.  This automatically includes in` :math:`T_c` `the
   effects of baryonic infall into CDM potential wells.  Note
   however that` :math:`T_b` `and` :math:`T_c` `are themselves not
   true transfer functions, as they do not reflect the density
   perturbations of the relevant species today.  Rather, it is
   their density weighted average` :math:`T(k)` `that is the
   transfer function for both the baryons and the CDM."`

   `"In the presence of baryons, the growth of CDM perturnbations
   is suppressed on scales below the sound horizon.  The change to
   the asymptotic form can be calculated and has been shown in
   equations (9)-(12).  We introduce this suppression by interpolating
   between two solutions near the sound horizon`

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
     T_c(k) &= f \tilde{T}_0(k, 1, \beta_c) +
     (1-f) \tilde{T}_0(k, \alpha_c, \beta_c) \\
     f &= \frac{1}{1 + (k\,s / 5.4)^4}"
   \end{aligned}

   -- EH98


.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
     \tilde{T}_0(k, \alpha_c, \beta_c) &=
     \frac{\ln(\exp + 1.8 \beta_c q)}
     {\ln(\exp + 1.8 \beta_c q) + C q^2}
   \end{aligned}

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
     C &= \frac{14.2}{\alpha_c} + \frac{386}{1 + 69.9 q^{1.08}}
   \end{aligned}



The Zero-Baryon Fit
===================

.. pull-quote::

    `"A commonly used fitting formula to the zero-baryon limit
    was presented in` Bardeen96_ `(Eq. G3).  However this formula
    fits neither the exact small-scale solution of Section 2.2 nor
    does it have the quadratic deviation from unity required by the
    theory.  The latter is a fundamental requirement of causality
    (Zeldovich, 1965, Adv. Astron. Astrophys., 3, 241), in that one
    power of` :math:`k` `must arise from stress gradients generating
    bulk velocity and a second from velocity gradients generating
    density perturbations.  In fact the coefficient of this quadratic
    derivation can be calculated pertubatively if the stress gradients
    are dominated by the isotropic (pressure) term.
    The following functional form satisfies these criteria and is a
    better fit to the zero-baryon case extrapolated from trace
    baryon models calculated by CMBfast."`

    -- EH98

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
      T_0(q) &= \frac{L_0}{L_0 + C_0 q^2} \\
      L_0(q) &= \ln(2 \exp + 1.8 q) \\
      C_0(q) &= 14.2 + \frac{731}{1 + 62.5 q}
    \end{aligned}

In this case, the wave number :math:`k` is parameterized, 

.. math::

    q = \frac{k}{h \, {\rm Mpc^{-1}}} \frac{\ThetaCMB^2}{\Gamma} 
      = \frac{k}{\rm Mpc^{-1}} \frac{\ThetaCMB^2}{\Omega_{\rm m} h^2} 
      = \frac{k}{13.41 k_{\rm eq}}


The No-Wiggles Fit
==================

The supression at high wave numbers due to baryons (but not the oscillations)
can be modelled by changing the parameterization of :math:`k` using an 
effective shape parameter :math:`\Gamma_{\rm eff}`.  The main form of the 
fit is the same as in the zero-baryon case. 

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
      T_0(q) &= \frac{L_0}{L_0 + C_0 q^2} \\
      L_0(q) &= \ln(2 \exp + 1.8 q) \\
      C_0(q) &= 14.2 + \frac{731}{1 + 62.5 q}
    \end{aligned}

But the wave number :math:`k` is parameterized using an effective shape 
parameter that is rescaled as one moves through the sound horizon,

.. math::

    q_{\rm eff} = \frac{k}{h \, {\rm Mpc^{-1}}}
    \frac{\ThetaCMB^2}{\Gamma_{\rm eff}}

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
      \Gamma_{\rm eff}(k) &= \Om h \left[ \aG +
        \frac{1 - \aG} {1 + (0.43\,k\,s)^4} \right] \\
      \aG &= 1 - 0.328 \ln(431 \Om h^2) \fb +
                 0.380 \ln(22.3 \Om h^2) \left(\fb\right)^2
    \end{aligned}

Redshift at matter-radiation equality
-------------------------------------

.. pull-quote::

    `"In the usual cosmological paradigm, nonrelativistic particles
    (baryons, electrons, and CDM) dominate relativistic particles
    (photons and massless neutrinos) in density today.  However,
    because the density of these two classes of particles scale
    differently in time, at an earlier time, the reverse situation
    held.  The transition from a radiation-dominated universe to a
    matter-dominated one occurs roughly at`

.. math::

Particle horizon scale at matter-radiation equality

    dominated universe versus a matter dominated one due to
    pressure support, the scale of the particle horizon at the

    `is imprinted on the matter transfer function; in particular,
    perturbations on smaller scales are supressed in amplitude in
    comparison to those on large scales."`

The redshift of the drag epoch
------------------------------

.. pull-quote::

    `"We thus define the drag epoch` :math:`z_d` `as the time at which
    the baryons are released from the Compton drag of the photons in
    terms of a weighted integral over the Thomson scattering rate
    (see` HS96_ `eqs. [C8], [E2]).  A fit to the numerical recombination
    results is`

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
      z_d &= 1291 \frac{(\Om h^2)^{0.251}}
        {1 + 0.659(\Om h^2)^{0.828}}
        [1 + b_1 (\Ob h^2)^{b_2}] \\
      b_1 &= 0.313 (\Om h^2)^{-0.419}
        [1 + 0.607 (\Om h^2)^{0.674}] \\
      b_2 &= 0.238 (\Om h^2)^{0.223}

.. pull-quote::

    `where we have reduced` :math:`z_d` `by a factor of 0.96 from`
    HS96_ `on phenomenological grounds.  For` :math:`\Ob h^2

    photons."`

Baryon to photon momentum density ratio
---------------------------------------

.. pull-quote::

    `"Prior to` :math:`z_d` `, small-scale perturbations in the
    photon-baryon fluid propagate as acoustic waves.  The sound speed
    is` :math:`c_s = 1 / [3(1+R)]^{1/2}` `(in units where the speed of
    light is unity) where R is the ratio of the baryon to photon
    momentum density,`

The sound horizon at the drag epoch
-----------------------------------

.. pull-quote::

    `"We define the sound horizon at the drag epoch as the co-moving
    distance a wave can travel prior to redshift`

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
      s &= \int_0^{t(z_d)} c_s (1 + z) dt \\
        &= \frac{2}{3 \keq} \sqrt{\frac{6}{R_{\rm eq}}} \ln

             {1 + \sqrt{R_{\rm eq}}}

.. pull-quote::

    `where` :math:`R_d \equiv R(z_d)` `and` :math:`R_{\rm eq} \equiv
    R(\zeq)` `are the values of` :math:`R` `at the drag epoch
    of matter-radiation equality, respectively."`

The Silk damping scale
----------------------

.. pull-quote::

    `"On small scales, the coupling between the baryons and the phtons is not
    perfect, such that the two species are able to diffuse past one another`
    (Silk_1968_) `.  The Silk damping scale is well fitted by the approximation`

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
      k_{\rm silk} = 1.6 (\Ob h^2)^{0.52} (\Om h^2)^{0.73}
      \left[ 1 + (10.4 \Om h^2)^{-0.95} \right]
    \end{aligned}

.. pull-quote::

    `which represents a` :math:`\pm 20\%` `phenomenological correction from
    the value given in` HS96_ `. The Silk scale is generally a smaller
    length scale than either` :math:`s` `or` :math:`k_{\rm eq}` `."`
